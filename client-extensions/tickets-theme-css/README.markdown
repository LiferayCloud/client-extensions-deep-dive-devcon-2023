# Live editing tickets-theme-css

By deploying the dev version of this client extension, the build is changed as follows:

- A custom gulpfile.mjs watches the .scss files in `src` and builds them using Dart SASS
- A javascript extension is deployed which enables Browsersync to run in Liferay
- When updates are made, Browsersync is notified and the css is updated without having to explicitly deploy or refresh the browser.

## Example:

![Example](./liveedit.gif)

## Limitations:

- Compiling clay is relatively slow (4-5 seconds) so be patient. But main.css changes are updated relatively quickly.
- This is a custom build that might not 100% reflect the normal gradle build

## Setup:

1. Deploy in dev mode:

    `../../gradlew clean deployDev packageRunServe`

2. Enable the Browsersync javascript extension. It is named "Tickets Theme Live JS" and needs to be added to whatever context you are using to test (e.g. you can add it to all pages or just the page you are testing)

3. Update scss files - the css changes should show automatically
